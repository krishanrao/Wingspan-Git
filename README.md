# Wingspan

## In our version of this game, we are trying to perform one of the following possible actions

* Gain Food
* Lay Eggs
* Draw Bird

## We are going to focus on Gain Food and Draw Card for the second iteration of our project

In this iteration, we are going to have each player hold 3 cards in the begining and a board array of 3 rows and 5 columns that is initialized with a default "Space object". Each "space object" is marked as "false" in the begining.  When the player choses to draw a card and place it on the board, the "space object" is replaced by a card of the players choice. For now, we have just marked the place on the board as "true".

We also have a functioanlity in the code, which enables the player to gain a food token and get rid of a card from the array of cards that the player was holding.

By 11/13 we aim to be able to complete these actions and move forward with other actions of laying eggs and drawing a bird.

Our schedules didn't allow us to allow a lot of functionality to our game but we plan to get more actions programmed in the next couple of days.
